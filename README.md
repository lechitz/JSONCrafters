# JSONCrafters
I crafted JSONCrafters to showcase efficient input collection and storage in JSON, exploring fundamental Go concepts. It simplifies data manipulation, providing insights into JSON analysis. Ideal for learners and projects needing dynamic data integration, JSONCrafters offers practical implementation, enhancing real-world skills.

## How to Use

1. **Run the Program:** In your terminal, execute the command `go run main.go` to start the program.
2. **Input Data:** Enter your name when prompted and then provide your address.
3. **JSON Output:** The program will transform your inputs into JSON format and display the result.

## Requirements

Make sure you have Go installed on your system before running the program. If you haven't installed Go, you can follow the official [Go installation guide](https://golang.org/doc/install) to set it up on your machine.

## Tips for Beginners

- **Check Go Installation:** Ensure Go is properly installed by typing `go version` in your terminal. If not installed, follow the official [installation guide](https://golang.org/doc/install) to set it up.
- **Understanding Terminal Commands:** Familiarize yourself with basic terminal commands, such as navigating directories (`cd`) and executing programs (`go run`).
- **Review Go Basics:** If you're new to Go, consider exploring Go's official [tour](https://tour.golang.org/welcome/1) to understand its fundamentals.
